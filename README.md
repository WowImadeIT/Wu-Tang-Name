### Technical Breakdown

* **LLM Integration:** The core of the name generation process relies on an **API call to a Large Language Model (LLM)**. A carefully crafted prompt guides the LLM to produce contextually relevant and themed names.

* **Frontend Stack:** The user interface is primarily developed using **TypeScript** for robust code, with styling managed by **CSS**. A touch of **JavaScript** handles dynamic elements and facilitates interaction with the LLM.

* **Project Context:** This project was developed as a personal endeavor, serving as an exploration into leveraging LLM capabilities within a fun, themed application.
