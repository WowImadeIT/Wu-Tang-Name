Technical Notes 
LLM Integration: The core name generation magic happens via an API call to an LLM (Large Language Model) of choice. The prompt is crafted to guide the LLM in generating those perfect, themed names.
Frontend Stack: The user interface is primarily built with TypeScript and styled using CSS. There's also a touch of JavaScript for dynamic elements and handling the LLM interaction.
Project Type: This was put together as a personal project, focusing on exploring LLM capabilities within a fun, themed application.
